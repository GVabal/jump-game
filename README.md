# Jump Game API

API, which tells whether the end of provided numbers sequence can be reached according to the gameâ€™s rules. Application will return already processed results from database, if provided sequence was requested before. 

**Game rules:**
Start at the first element. Current element value indicates how many steps you can take at most. For example: if the value is 3, then you can take 0, 1, 2 or 3 steps. If the value is 0 then you stop. Numbers sequence that can reach the last element is considered winnable.

Run with Docker:
`docker run -p {your port}:8080 gvabal/jump-game-api`

Run with Maven:
`./mvnw package && java -jar target/*.jar`

**Endpoints** (assuming the application is running locally on port 80):

`curl -X GET http://localhost/jump-game`

- returns all sequences from database

`curl -X GET http://localhost/jump-game/{id}` 

- returns sequence by id

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"list":[1,2,3,4,5]}' http://localhost/jump-game` 

- takes list of digits in json body, processes it and returns json object of the sequence. If sequence has been requested to calculate before, returns that sequence instead.

`curl -X DELETE http://localhost/jump-game` 

- deletes all sequences from database. For convenience
