# Jump Game API

API, which tells whether the end of provided numbers sequence can be reached according to the gameâ€™s rules. Application will return already processed results from database, if provided sequence was requested before. 

Run with Docker:
`docker run -p {your port}:8080 gvabal/jump-game-api`

Run with Maven:
`./mvnw package && java -jar target/*.jar`

Endpoints (assuming the application is running locally on port 80):

`curl -X GET http://localhost/jump-game`

- returns all sequences from database

`curl -X GET http://localhost/jump-game/{id}` 

- returns sequence by id

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"list":[1,2,3,4,5]}' http://localhost/jump-game` 

- takes list of digits in json body, processes it and returns json object of the sequence. If sequence has been requested to calculate before, returns that sequence instead.

`curl -X DELETE http://localhost/jump-game` 

- deletes all sequences from database. For convenience
